				<h2>Benefits of the Markup language</h2>
				<p>The primary benefit, and intent, of markup languages is that they are supported on all browsers though not all browsers read code in the same way. Though there are some browsers that read markups differently, there are ways to inform the browser to handle these discrepancies. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has a set of standards to which most browsers adhere.
					<blockquote>
						<p>"Sticking with web standards is your primary tool for ensuring your site is consistent on all standards-compliant browsers (that’s approximately 99% of browsers in current use). It also helps make your content forward-compatible as web technologies and browser capabilities evolve. Another benefit is that you can tell your clients that you create “standards-compliant” sites, and they will like you more."</p>

					</blockquote>
				<p>Since most browsers are compliant it makes using markup languages simple. Though it is always good practice to check and see if the function you are trying to perform is compatable with the vast majority of browsers. There are also hundreds of free resources one can use online to help verify if a website is compatible with certain browsers and the W3C standards.</p>
