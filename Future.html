				<h2>The Future of Markup languages</h2>
				<p>As technology gets more complex and web browsers become more powerful, W3C and other companies are looking to improve and modify markup languages. Companies like Adobe want to move HTML towards using a fully XML compliant syntax. The purpose of this integration is to make data universally readable on the web. We are moving close to that future every day with markups such as XHTML and the integration will only improve with time.</p>

				<p>Another area where W3C is working to improve markup languages is in Accesability and Ethics. As we become more connected via the internet, privacy has become an increasing concern. W3C is always looking for ways to increase the privacy of users. Some of these privacy solutions are facilitated via the broswers, such as disallowing certain pseudo-tags as they can be seen as a "security risk". As a web designer it is always important to understand how information will affect your end user and how you are protecting your users' privacy.</p>
